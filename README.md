# Ecommerce Frontend

This is the **frontend** for the Ecommerce project. It is built using **React** and is designed to work seamlessly with the **backend** available in my GitHub repository:  
[Ecommerce Backend](https://github.com/srinithreddy16/Ecommerce_Backend)

---

## Features

- Responsive and modern UI for an online store  
- Product listing, details, and search functionality  
- User authentication and profile management  
- Shopping cart and checkout integration  
- Communicates with backend APIs for products, orders, and users  

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)  
- npm (comes with Node.js)
